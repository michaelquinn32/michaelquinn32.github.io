# The Big Blog of R Adventures

This the personal blog of Michael Quinn, a professional statistician and generally curious person. It is a fork of [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), and the pages are built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/). Feel free to share, fork and criticize however you see fit.
