# Bayesian Portfolio Optimization in R

The project was originally a paper that I published in the Central Asia Business Journal, which is [edited by former colleagues at KIMEP university](http://kimep.kz/academics/en/central-asia-business-journal/). I'm sure that the digital edition of the most recent version will eventually go up. Or at least I hope.

Since the code was originally structured to accompany a paper, it's a bit of a mess right now. But I'm coercing it into a package, so that it might be useful to someone intrepid researcher wishing to reproduce the results published by the leading English-lange business journal in Central Asia. I'm sure it will be a great honor!

The package implements several Bayesian estimators for the parameters in a classic Markowitz portfolio optimization algorithm. A Gibbs sampler is used to find the Bayesian estimates.
